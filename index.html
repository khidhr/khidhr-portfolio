            <p><strong>Problem statement:</strong></p>
            <p>Skin cancer is a common disease caused by abnormal skin cell growth due to DNA damage from UV radiation (sun or tanning beds). It has three main types: basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma. Melanoma is the least common but the most dangerous, as it spreads rapidly and can be lethal if not detected early.</p>
            <p><strong>Contribution:</strong></p>
            <p>I developed a hybrid quantum architecture i call as <em>QUNET</em> to embed, classify and segment skin cancer images, projecting data in the highly dimentional <em>Hilbert space</em> has proven to be more efficient for class separation, the project integrates quantum trainable layers to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, aiding doctors in decision-making and fostering advancements in healthcare and quantum technology applications.</strong></p>
